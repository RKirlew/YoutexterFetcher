# YoutexterFetcher
This script fetches text found in a Youtube video and prints it out. Uses pytesseract for OCR on every Nth frame of a video. I hate when I have to watch an entire video just to find some
key points. This script puts an end to that, it fetches any text on every Nth frame of a video and checks for text, you no longer have to go to the comments section to find a list of keypoints.
Only works if the Youtuber puts text for every key point they mention in their video.
